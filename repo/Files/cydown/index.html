<br>Install paid packages for Free in Cydia! I'm not going to update this package because if I do then you will have to buy a license for $3.99 to be able to use the paid packages free feature. So this is if you want to downgrade from 6.0.7 to 6.0.6 where you don't have to buy a license. Because it's it's supposed to be free.</div>
