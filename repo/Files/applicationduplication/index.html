Application Duplication lets you have 2 of the same app on your springboard.. builds from installed apps and puts ipa with artwork in Installous Downloads for install. Now some apps will be created and install but will crash on launch. sorry i dont have a solution yet. Usage run 'appdub' [ AppFolder.app ] or option [ -l ] lists all App Folders ex. appdub DoodleJump.app or 'appdub -l'<br><br>
