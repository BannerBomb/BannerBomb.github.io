<div id="content" style="display:none">
I am working on various small projects and things in several programming languages like<br>
C, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, AutoIT, Objective-C/Cocoa Touch, Logos, Lua, TIBasic and RoboPro.<br>
I am too lazy to count up every single code snippet i ever wrote, so contact me if you are<br>
interested in any of these languages, i maybe have some cool stuff waiting for you.<br><br>
I am currently doing very much stuff in the (jailbroken) iPhone and Cocoa Touch and Logos and<br>
MobileSubstrate (now CydiaSubstrate) and Objective-C direction so if you landed here by destiny<br>
and want to learn about such stuff i am your man!<br><br>
I am also the guy who made watchscreen and ClassicLock Cydget, both available on Cydia, if you have a<br>
jailbreak on your iPhone or iPad with iOS 6 or iOS 7.<br>
