<h3>A feature Apple, should have implemented way earlier</h3>
NCforward is a small project i started to implement a feature Apple should have implemented way earlier.
The feature is to forward every single notification you get on your loved iDevice to any other computer.
No matter what OS, no matter how these are displayed, just forward them, anywhere.
